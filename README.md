If you want to run the app locally, remember to migrate the db and do bundle install. 

We've created 3 profiles so you can use the different features based on which one you choose

- If you want to have access to the Admin dashboard, add/edit/remove/delete products/users/reviews, and accept/decline requests, log in as Admin. 

- If you want to do the same except having access to the Admin dashboard, log in as Moderator. 

- If you want to have the user experience, asking for products, reviewing them, and chatting with moderator, log in as user. 



Admin: mail = admin@base.com
password = 123456



Moderator: mail = moderator@base.com
password = 123456

 

User: mail = user@base.com
password = 123456

As the team 74 of IIC2143-2022-2, we really hope you enjoy our first Application :).
